# Rules Reference

## Exchange
During an Exchange:
1. The Troopers determine their **Intent**
2. The Squad makes an **Offense Roll**
3. Troopers make their **Defense Rolls**
4. Impact on **Momentum** is resolved
5. Enemies telegraph their **Tactics**

### Intent
Every Trooper that isn't currently **Bleeding Out** or **Dead** determines their course of action during this Exchange.

#### Fire
The Trooper contributes +1d6 to the Offense Roll. Add +1d6 for each of the following: Flanking, expanding 1 Ammo. Subtract -1d6 when Limited. Gear can also add or subtract d6’s.

#### Move
The Trooper repositions to alter their Offensive or Defensive Position.
- Move Up. The Trooper improves their Offensive Position by 1 tier (Limited > Engaged > Flanking). Roll 1d6: on a 1-4, the Trooper is now Flanked. On a 5-6, the Trooper is now In Cover.
- Fall Back. The Trooper improves their Defensive Position by 1 tier (Flanked > In Cover > Fortified). Roll 1d6: on a 1-4, the Trooper is now Limited. On a 5-6, the Trooper is now Engaged.
A Trooper can roll the d6 to see what options are available, and then choose to commit to moving, or take another action.

#### Covering Fire

The Trooper adds **+1d6** to the **Defense Roll** of a *Moving* or *Interacting* Trooper.

#### Use Special Gear

Use heavy weaponry such as rocket launchers, snipers and LMGs, or radio for an airstrike.

#### Interact

The Trooper performs an action not directly related to the firefight. This can be stabilizing a Trooper who is **Bleeding Out**, reload a jammed weapon, planting demolition charges etc.

#### Disengage

If the entire Squad decides to retreat from this Engagement, all Troopers act as if they are Falling Back, and make a final **Defense Roll.** Whoever survives, successfully flees the battlefield. The Squad retreats to their previous Sector.

### Offense Roll

The Offense Roll resolves all **Fire** actions. 
- Roll all **d6** and take the **highest value**. 
- Add **+1d6** if **Momentum** was gained in the previous Exchange. 
- Add **+1d6** if a Trooper died in the previous Exchange.
  
If the total sum of d6's amounts to **0d6**, roll 2d6 and pick the lowest value. *Success at a Cost* is not available with 0d6.

| Offense Roll | Result (Threat Level 1 or 2)                 | Result (Threat Level 3 or 4)                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | **Pushed Back**                              | **Pushed Back**                              |
| 2            | **Pushed Back**                              | **Pushed Back**                              |
| 3            | **Pushed Back**                              | **Pushed Back**                              |
| 4            | **Hold Position** *or* **Success at a Cost** | **Hold Position**                            |
| 5            | **Hold Position** *or* **Success at a Cost** | **Hold Position** *or* **Success at a Cost** |
| 6            | **Success**                                  | **Success**                                  |

- **Pushed Back.** Lose **-1 Momentum**.
- **Hold Position.** No change in **Momentum**.
- **Success at a Cost.** Gain **+1 Momentum**. (Randomly) pick a Trooper most at-risk in fiction; the Trooper in the worst Defensive Position, that is not being protected by *Covering Fire*. This Trooper has **-1d6** on their **Defense Roll.**
- **Success.** Gain **+1 Momentum**. If two or more **6's** are rolled, gain an additional **+1 Momentum**.

If the Momentum gain from *Success* is enough to defeat the enemy, the Engagement ends in victory - return to the **Mission Phase** and **Catch Breath**. If the Momentum gain from *Success at a Cost* wins the Engagement, make a final **Defense Roll** and *then* return to the **Mission Phase** to **Catch Breath.**

The effects of losing or gaining Momentum are otherwise resolved after the **Defense Roll**.

### Defense Roll

Each Trooper rolls individually to resist incoming attacks:

- Roll **1d6** by default.
- If protected by **Covering Fire**, add **+1d6**.
- If affected by **Success at a Cost**, subtract **-1d6**.

If a Trooper ends up with **0d6**, roll **2d6** and take the **lowest**. If rolling **2d6 or more**, take the **highest** result. A Trooper can use **1 Grit** to reroll 1d6, but must take the new result. A Trooper suffers an **Injury** if their final result is *equal to or below* the following:

- **Fortified:** Injury on **1**
- **In Cover** or **Falling Back:** Injury on **1–2**
- **Flanked** or **Moving Up:** Injury on **1–3**

**Heavy Armor** lowers the Injury range by 1 step - for example, a Trooper *In Cover* with Heavy Armor is only injured on a 1.
