# Rules Reference

## Exchange
During an Exchange:
1. The Troopers determine their **Intent**
2. The Squad makes an **Offense Roll**
3. Troopers make their **Defense Rolls**
4. Impact on **Momentum** is resolved
5. Enemies telegraph their **Tactics**

### Intent
Every Trooper that isn't currently **Bleeding Out** or **Dead** determines their course of action during this Exchange.

#### Fire
The Trooper contributes +1d6 to the Offense Roll. Add +1d6 for each of the following: Flanking, expanding 1 Ammo. Subtract -1d6 when Limited. Gear can also add or subtract d6’s.

#### Move
The Trooper repositions to alter their Offensive or Defensive Position.
- Move Up. The Trooper improves their Offensive Position by 1 tier (Limited > Engaged > Flanking). Roll 1d6: on a 1-4, the Trooper is now Flanked. On a 5-6, the Trooper is now In Cover.
- Fall Back. The Trooper improves their Defensive Position by 1 tier (Flanked > In Cover > Fortified). Roll 1d6: on a 1-4, the Trooper is now Limited. On a 5-6, the Trooper is now Engaged.
A Trooper can roll the d6 to see what options are available, and then choose to commit to moving, or take another action.

#### Covering Fire

The Trooper adds **+1d6** to the **Defense Roll** of a *Moving* or *Interacting* Trooper.

#### Use Special Gear

Use heavy weaponry such as rocket launchers, snipers and LMGs, or radio for an airstrike.

#### Interact

The Trooper performs an action not directly related to the firefight. This can be stabilizing a Trooper who is **Bleeding Out**, reload a jammed weapon, planting demolition charges etc.

#### Disengage

If the entire Squad decides to retreat from this Engagement, all Troopers act as if they are Falling Back, and make a final **Defense Roll.** Whoever survives, successfully flees the battlefield. The Squad retreats to their previous Sector.
