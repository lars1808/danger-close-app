# Rules Reference

## Round Structure
1. **Command Phase** – Issue orders and resolve start-of-round effects.
2. **Action Phase** – Units alternate activating to move, attack, and interact.
3. **End Phase** – Resolve end-of-round triggers and refresh spent resources.

## Quick Reminders
- Reroll dice only once per roll unless an ability states otherwise.
- Cover reduces incoming damage by 1 (to a minimum of 1).
- A unit cannot hold more than 3 objective tokens at a time.

## Conditions
### Suppressed
- Unit suffers `-1` to attack rolls.
- Remove the condition after the unit spends an action to Rally.

### Inspired
- Gain `+1` to defense tests.
- Expires at the end of the round or after scoring a critical hit.
